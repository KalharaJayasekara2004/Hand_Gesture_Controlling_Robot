# Hand Gesture-Controlled Robot with Gripper Expansion

This is a gesture-controlled robot project using ESP32 and MPU6050 IMU, with a gripper expansion. The robot uses two ESP32 boards for transmitter and receiver communication and comes with STL files for the chassis.

## Features
- Gesture control using MPU6050 IMU
- Gripper mechanism for object manipulation
- ESP32-CAM for wireless video streaming
- Transmitter and receiver using ESP32 boards
- Fully 3D-printable chassis

## Components
- ESP32 boards (x2)
- MPU6050 IMU
- TB6612 FNG motor drivers(x2)
- Gripper expansion
- Servo motor for gripper
- ESP32-cam
- Mecanum wheels(x4)
- TT gear motors(x4)
- 3.7V Li-ion batteries(x3)
- Miscellaneous electronics and mechanical parts
- STL files for chassis

## File Structure
- Code- Arduino sketches for transmitter and receiver
- 3D Files - STL files for 3D printing chassis
- Images - Photos of the assembled robot

## Usage
1. Upload the `Transmitter.ino` sketch to the transmitter ESP32.
2. Upload the `Receiver.ino` sketch to the receiver ESP32.
3. Assemble the robot chassis using the STL files.
4. Connect hardware.
5. Power the ESP32 boards and test gestures.
